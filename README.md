# GGJ2019
Global Game Jam January 2019.

We had 48 hours to make a game based on the theme, which was "What Home means to You".
We decided to use two of the diversifiers:
- Thomas Wasn't Alone (Use only simple shapes (cubes, triangles, circles, etc.) to represent every single element (characters, HUD, etc.) inside the game.)
- Wanderlust (Your game tries to awaken interest in travel and visiting new places, with a focus on your home town.)

Team Members:
- Anthony Beacock
- Jakob Scrivener
- Dean Barnard
- Ben Mullenger
- Damon Moore
